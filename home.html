	<h1>What Horizon Zero Dawn Should Have Done</h1>
		<p>I don't know about the rest of you, but I am so excited for the game trailers we have seen so far this year. The game that Ninja Theory is developing now delves into Celtic Mythology, and mental illness. The games seen at GamesCon and at Paris Games Week look phenomenal. I just have one problem, and it is one that is seen all to often in the gaming community. Which is the lack of representaion of POC as playable main characters while still using our methods of storytelling.</p>
		<p> Horizon Zero Dawn is especially guilty of this. Yes it is set in a post apocalyptic future, but take a good look at the trailer. Look at the themeing of it all! It is much more than vaguely native american!</p>
		<p>What I thought was very interesting was the gameplay that was showcased. We see the main character kill an animal and then apologize to it. This is something that is fetured in another wildly popular game that actually stars a Native American protagonist.</p>
		<p>This is why I am disappointed. Here the developer had a wonderful chance to include a main character that reflects the core of the narrative, but they chose to ignore it. Whether or not you are able to play as a POC in the game is yet to be seen. As we see in the trailer there are some POC characters shown when the protagonist speaks of the "Other Tribes". My question is this; In a world so richin diversity why does this main character have to be white? Why not have a character that more accurately reflects the type of feeling that is so clearly given off in the trailer? At the end of the day, when everything is said and done, it really comes down to the fact that we are tired of not being represented in a community that we helped to build.</p>
